# TestingHCFCore
A kotlin hcf core that I made cause I was super bored. It uses gradle and has no other dependencies besides spigot and mongodb. If you are a small to medium size hcf server you can use this core once its complete but I do not recommend using it now cause it super minimal.

# Features

- System and Player faction creation, editing, and claiming
- Elevator signs fully working
- KOTHs with rewards when they are complete
- Timer system
- Profiling system with built-in economy
- Statistics and kitmap mode
- SOTW timer with /sotw enable
- PvP Class system
- Polished and clean looking scoreboard
- Many more to come :^)
